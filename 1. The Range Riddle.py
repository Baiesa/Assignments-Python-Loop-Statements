Task 2: 
Your Mood Today
Write a program that simulates different moods for each day of the week. Create a list of moods
such as "Happy", "Sad", "Energetic", and "Calm". Using the range() function, 
loop through the days of the week and for each day, randomly select a mood from the list and print it.
Ensure that your program includes the use of the random module to select the mood.
'''

# import random
# moods = ["happy", "sad", "energitic", "calm"]
# days_of_week = ["saturday", " sunday", "monday", "tuesday", "wendsday", "thursday", "friday"]

# for i in range(len(days_of_week)):
#     mood = random.choice(moods)
#     print(f"ON {days_of_week[i]}, I Feel {mood}. ")

'''
Task 3: 
Going Backwards
Create a countdown timer that starts from 10 and counts down to 1. 
Use the range() function to generate the countdown sequence. Each number should be printed on a new line.
This task will help you understand how to generate a decreasing sequence with range().
