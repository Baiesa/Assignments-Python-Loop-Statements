'''
Task 1: 
Loop Condition Exploration
Write a while loop with a condition that will never be true (an infinite loop). 
Inside the loop, print a statement. Then, use a break statement to exit the loop after 5 iterations.

'''

# count = 0
# while True:
#     print("inside the infite loop")
#     count +=1
#     if count >=5:
#         break

'''
Task 2: 
Conditional Exit
Modify the infinite loop from Task 1 to include a condition that will eventually be true and remove the break statement. 
The loop should terminate naturally once the condition is met.
'''
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("inside the loop")
    count +=1
